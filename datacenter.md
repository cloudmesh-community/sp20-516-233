## E.DataCenter.4 Thermal

Thermal energy is the energy gained or lost by transfering heat from one place 
to another. In the case of data centers, thermal energy is often removed so they 
can cool down. Data centers located in cooler regions such as Verne Global's 
Iceland data center and Facebook's Luleå, use natually chilled air from the outside 
instead of air conditioning. The air is filtered before entering the data center to 
ensure particles and moisture do not damage the equipment.

Another form of thermal energy employed by data centers is using the earth 
underground to cool off pipes in a closed-loop system. These pipes carry water 
and/or coolant that take away heat from the data center and then dissiapates 
the heat into the earth. The liquid in the pipes is then resued in the 
closed-loop pipe system to take heat away from the data center and the process 
is repeated. Data centers that use this form of thermal energy include the 
American College Testing data center and Prairie Bunkers Data Center Park.
