# Hyper-V Concepts sp20-516-233 Holly Zhang

## Requirements

### Operating System

Either of the following Windows 10 operating systems are needed to run Hyper-V 
[@hyper-v-requirements].

> * Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise
> * Microsoft Windows 10 Pro
> * Microsoft Windows 10 EDU

### Hardware

Check whether Hyper-V is able to operate on the hardware by entering the 
following command in either Powershell or Command Prompt:

```bash
$ systeminfo
```
Scroll through the output until the section `Hyper-V Requirements:` is found. If 
all requirements have `Yes` next to them, then Hyper-V can be used once it is 
enabled [@hyper-v-requirements]. If the `Data Execution Prevention Available:` 
requirement says `No`, the system BIOS will need to be adjusted. Make sure that 
`Hardware Enforced Data Execution Prevention` and `Virtualization Technology` 
are enabled in the system BIOS. It is possible that `Virtualization Technology` 
is listed under a different name depending on the manufacturer 
[@hyper-v-requirements]. 

## Features

Hyper-V has two main features, `Hyper-V Management Tools` and 
`Hyper-V Platform`. Withing these two features are two more features. The 
following list shows how the features are structured:

> * Hyper-V Management Tools
>   * Hyper-V Platform
>   * Hyper-V Platform
> * Hyper-V Platform
>   * Hyper-V Hypervisor
>   * Hyper-V Services

## Hyper-V management from CMD.EXE

### Enable Hyper-V from CMD.EXE

To enable Hyper-V from Command Prompt, first start Command Prompt as 
Administrator. Remember to save any work as this will require a system reboot. 
On the command line, enter the following command:

```bash
$ DISM /Online /Enable-Feature /All /FeatureName:Microsoft-Hyper-V
```
When prompted, restart the machine. Hyper-V will now be enabled on the machine.

### Disable Hyper-V from CMD.EXE

Before disabling Hyper-V, save any work on the machine since a system reboot 
will be required. Open Command Prompt as Administrator and enter the following 
command:

```bash
$ DISM /Online /Disable-Feature:Microsoft-Hyper-V
```
 
 When prompted, restart the machine for the command to affect. This is for 
 disabling Hyper-V services only. All Hyper-V files will still be on the 
 machine.
 
## Hyper-V management from Powershell

### Enable Hyper-V

First start Powershell as Administrator. There are two ways to enable Hyper-V 
from Powershell. Only choose one of the the following commands. 

Run the following command:
 
```bash
$ Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All
```

**OR** run this following command:

```bash
$ DISM /Online /Enable-Feature /All /FeatureName:Microsoft-Hyper-V
```

### Disable Hyper-V

Make sure to save any work on the machine since this will require a system 
reboot. To disable Hyper-V, start Powershell as Administrator, and then enter 
the following command:

```bash
$ Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V 
``` 

Restart the machine when asked to in order for the changes to be made.

### More Hyper-V Commands

A more extensive list of Hyper-V commands on Powershell can be be found at: 
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/hyper-v/?view=win10-ps>.

## Multipass Benchmark

### Windows 10 Pro and EDU

After enabling Hyper-V as shown in the previous section, Multipass can be now be 
downloaded from <https://multipass.run/>. Find the download button for Windows 
and press it to obtain the executable file. Then run the executable file to 
install Multipass.  

### Windows 10 Home

Hyper-V is not supported for Windows 10 Home. In order to install Multipass, 
either Virtualbox needs to be installed or the operating system needs to be 
upgraded to Windows 10 Pro or EDU. The following two subsections show how to 
prepare the installation for Virtualbox on Windows Home or how to upgrade to 
Windows 10 Pro or EDU. 

#### Disable Hyper-V Before Virtualbox Installation

Before installing Virtualbox, make sure that Hyper-V has been disabled. The 
previous section includes commands to disable Hyper-V. Once Hyper-V is disabled, 
Virtualbox can be installed at <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>.

#### Upgrade Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro or EDU

For those who already have a Windows operating system but not Windows 10 Pro or 
EDU, downloading the Windows installer can be skipped. What is needed instead is 
a product key. When getting the product key, choose the 64-bit OS. A product key 
for Windows 10 Pro 64-bit can be obtained at 
<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/windows?activetab=tab:shopwindows10>. 
Windows 10 EDU 64-bit is provided free of charge for 
Indiana University students at <https://iuware.iu.edu/Windows/Title/2977>.

Once the product key is obtained, navigate to the
