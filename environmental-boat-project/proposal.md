# Environmental Robot Boat sp20-516-233 Holly Zhang

## Abstract

We introduce a network architecture using MQTT services to send sensor data from 
an environmental robot boat to various cloud AI services. 

## Evaluating Messaging Protocols

### MQTT

### STOMP

### AMQP

This will most likely not be used in the project since the Python library for 
AMQP does not support Python 3.8 [@amqp]. Furthermore, it is mostly used in 
industrial settings.  

## Evaluating Messaging Toolkits

### MQTT Toolkits

#### Paho Python Client

Will most likely use this since MQTT uses low energy.

#### Mosquitto Python Client



### STOMP Toolkits


### Polygot Toolkits

#### RabbitMQ
