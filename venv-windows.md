By default, Command Prompt starts out in the home directory. However if the 

current directory is not the home directory, then the following command can be 

used.

```bash
>cd %HOMEPATH%
```

The command below creates a python environment in a directory called ENV3.

```bash
>python -m venv ENV3
```

The following code is used to activate the environment. 

```bash
>ENV3\Scripts\activate
```

To deactivate the python environment, type the command below in Command Prompt.

```bash
>deactivate
```
